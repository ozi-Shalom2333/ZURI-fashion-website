## Project Overview
ZURI is a fictional fashion brand focused on sustainable, African-inspired clothing. This static website serves as a prototype for an e-commerce platform, featuring a homepage, product listings, product details, shopping cart, checkout, user authentication (login/signup), an "Our Story" page, and a contact page. The design emphasizes accessibility, responsiveness, and a modern aesthetic with smooth animations and intuitive navigation.

The project is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a modular structure to facilitate future integration with JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js) or a backend (e.g., Express.js).

- *External Resources*: Unsplash for product image placeholders.

## Setup Instructions
To run the ZURI website locally, follow these steps:

1. *Clone or Download the Repository*:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zuri-fashion-website.git
   
   Alternatively, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*:
   bash
   cd zuri-fashion-website
   

3. *Open the Website*:
   - Option 1: Open index.html directly in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
   - Option 2: Serve the project using a local development server for a better experience:
     bash
     npm install -g live-server
     live-server
     
     This will launch the website at http://localhost:8080.

4. *Explore the Pages*:
   Navigate through the site using the links in the navigation bar (Home, Shop, Our Story, Contact, Login, Cart).

## Usage
- **Homepage (index.html): View the hero section and featured products. Click "Explore The Collection" to visit the shop.
- **Shop (shop.html): Browse all products with hover effects linking to product details.
- **Product Detail (product-detail.html): View product information and select size/quantity.
- **Cart (cart.html): Review cart items, adjust quantities, or proceed to checkout.
- **Checkout (checkout.html): Fill out shipping and payment details (demo only).
- **Login/Signup (login.html, signup.html): Simulate user account creation and login.
- **Our Story (our-story.html): Learn about ZURI’s mission and heritage.
- **Contact (contact.html): Submit inquiries via the form or view contact details.

The site is static, so forms (e.g., signup, contact) do not process data. To add functionality, integrate a backend (see [Future Enhancements](#future-enhancements)).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature).
3. Make changes and commit (git commit -m "Add your feature").
4. Push to your branch (git push origin feature/your-feature).
5. Open a pull request with a description of your changes.

Please ensure code follows the project’s style guide (consistent indentation, semantic HTML, and CSS variable usage).

## Future Enhancements
- *Backend Integration*: Add a Node.js/Express.js backend to handle form submissions (e.g., contact, signup) and store cart/order data.
- *Framework Migration*: Convert the front-end to a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js for reusable components and state management.
- *Form Validation*: Implement client-side validation for forms (e.g., email format, required fields) using JavaScript.
- *Payment Processing*: Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Paystack) for real checkout functionality.
- *SEO Optimization*: Use a static site generator like Next.js or Gatsby for better search engine visibility.
- *Map Integration*: Add a Google Maps embed on the contact page for the store address.
- *Dynamic Cart*: Enable real-time cart updates using localStorage or a backend API.
